## 📌 Overview

**Compassionate Logic** is an ethical operating system designed for high-entropy informational environments. It addresses the **Epistemological Collapse**—the systemic erosion of shared truth-verification methods—by providing a rigorous alternative to the binary choice between "brutal honesty" and "paternalistic deception."

The **Gardener's Calculus** is the operational engine of this framework: an eight-step, auditable protocol for leaders, parents, and systems architects. It guides the timing, sequencing, and scaffolding of difficult truths to prevent **Ontological Harm** (psychological or systemic collapse) while maintaining a commitment to eventual, full transparency.

### The Core Axiom
> **Protocol Rule 1:** The default ethical stance is candor with informed consent. Any deviation from immediate transparency is an exceptional, time-bounded, and auditable act of last resort.

## ⚖️ The Three Pillars

### 1. Ontological Harm
A specific category of injury where the disclosure of true information overwhelms the recipient's capacity for regulation, causing trauma, identity fragmentation, or institutional collapse.

### 2. Pragmatic Veracity
The ethical practice of honoring the truth by responsibly managing its **velocity** and **framing**. It distinguishes between withholding for manipulation (unethical) and withholding for scaffolding (ethical).

### 3. Generative Guidance
The commitment to use any period of temporary shielding to actively build the recipient's resilience. The steward moves from **Oracle** (providing answers) to **Coach** (building capacity), utilizing the **Scaffolding Ladder** to prepare the recipient for the full truth.

## 🧮 The 8-Step Calculus (Summary)

The protocol moves from establishing legitimacy to ensuring accountability.

| Phase | Step | Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **I. Establishment** | **1. Legitimacy** | Confirm role-based duty of care. |
| | **2. Subsidiarity** | Check if a closer/better steward exists. |
| **II. Diagnosis** | **3. Harm Assessment** | Score Severity & Immediacy (1–5). |
| | **4. Readiness Assessment** | Score Cognitive, Emotional, & Support capacity (1–5). |
| **III. Strategy** | **5. Intervention Gradient** | Exhaust less intrusive options (Framing $\to$ Sequencing). |
| | **6. The Gambit** | Choose the minimal necessary shield (Compassionate Inaccuracy). |
| **IV. Accountability** | **7. Disclosure Debt** | Define the **Sunset Condition** (Deadline/Milestone). |
| | **8. Oversight & Aftercare** | Register with an Auditor; plan the Scaffolding Ladder. |

## 🧗 The Scaffolding Ladder (Appendix B)

The mechanism for repaying the **Disclosure Debt**.

1.  **Emotional Regulation:** Restore physiological baseline (Co-regulation).
2.  **Sense-Making:** Move from affect to coherent narrative.
3.  **Perspective-Taking:** Generate alternative hypotheses.
4.  **Metacognition:** Identify internal scripts.
5.  **Epistemic Humility:** Full disclosure and integration.

## 🤝 Contributing & Evolution

Ethics is a collaborative discipline. We invite ethicists, psychologists, crisis managers, and AI safety researchers to help refine the protocol.

### How to Contribute:
*   **Edge Cases:** Submit scenarios where the Calculus breaks or yields ambiguous results via Issues.
*   **Cultural Calibration:** Help us adapt the Harm/Readiness rubrics for non-Western or high-context cultures.
*   **Institutional Forks:** Propose specific adaptations for Medicine, Law, or Military contexts.

### The RFC Process:
1.  **Open an Issue:** Use the "Ethical Dilemma" tag to propose a modification.
2.  **Discussion:** The community will stress-test the proposal against the **Non-Derogable Constraints** (No Permanent Concealment, No Self-Dealing).
3.  **Pull Request:** Updates to the `/latex` source or `/templates` are merged after review.
