# Contributing to the Gardener's Calculus

Thank you for your interest in improving the **Gardener's Calculus (Compassionate Logic)** protocol. Ethics is a collaborative discipline, and this framework requires diverse perspectives to ensure it remains robust, culturally adaptable, and practically useful in high-stakes environments.

## 🛠 Areas of Contribution

We welcome contributions in the following categories:

1. **Domain-Specific Forks:** Proposing adaptations of the Calculus for specific high-risk fields (e.g., Emergency Medicine, Military Command, Intelligence Analysis, or Child Protective Services).
2. **Cultural Calibration:** Helping us refine the 1–5 scales for "Harm" and "Readiness" to better reflect non-Western, collectivist, or high-context cultural norms.
3. **Scaffolding Techniques:** Suggesting new, evidence-based methodologies for the *Scaffolding Ladder* (Appendix B) to help repay Disclosure Debt more effectively.
4. **Edge Case Analysis:** Submitting real-world scenarios where the Calculus yields ambiguous results or fails to prevent harm, to help us refine the decision logic.

## 🚦 The RFC (Request for Comments) Process

To ensure the framework remains ethically sound and consistent with the core axiom ("Candor with Consent"), all substantive changes follow a formal process:

### 1. Open an Issue
Before submitting a Pull Request, please open a GitHub Issue using the **Ethical Dilemma** tag. Describe the proposed change, the reasoning behind it, and how it aligns with the Non-Derogable Constraints.

### 2. Community Discussion
The proposal will be open for feedback. We aim for a discussion period that includes input from diverse fields (ethics, psychology, crisis management) to stress-test the proposal against potential misuse.

### 3. Stress-Test Review
The protocol stewards (Meaningfulness Media Group) will review the proposal against the **Non-Derogable Constraints**:
*   Does this enable permanent concealment?
*   Does this allow for self-dealing?
*   Does this weaken the duty of repair?
*   *If the answer to any is YES, the proposal will be rejected.*

### 4. Pull Request (PR)
Once a proposal is validated, you may submit a PR. 
*   Edits to the White Paper MUST be made to the `.tex` files in the `/latex` directory.
*   Updates to operational tools MUST be reflected in the `/templates` directory.

## 📜 Submission Guidelines

### Labels
Please use the following labels for your issues:
*   `calibration`: For adjusting Harm/Readiness scoring rubrics.
*   `domain-fork`: For industry-specific adaptations.
*   `edge-case`: For scenarios that challenge the current logic.
*   `bug`: For errors in the LaTeX source or templates.

### Pull Request Requirements
*   **Ethical Safety:** Any change to the decision logic must be accompanied by a "Red Team" analysis (how could a bad actor misuse this change?).
*   **Version Consistency:** Substantive changes will be bundled into **Minor Versions** (v1.x). Do not update the version number in your PR; stewards will handle versioning during the release cycle.
