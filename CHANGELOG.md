## [1.0.1] - 2026-01-24

### Added
- **Uses:** Added a new Appendix to illustrate use cases, applied scenarios for the Gardener's Calculus.

---

## [1.0.0] - 2026-01-18

### Added
- **Core Framework:** Formalized the three pillars of Compassionate Logic: *Ontological Harm*, *Pragmatic Veracity*, and *Generative Guidance*.
- **The Calculus:** Established the 8-Step decision protocol, moving from Legitimacy (Step 1) to Oversight (Step 8).
- **Assessment Rubrics:** Defined the 1–5 Likert scales for Harm Assessment (Severity/Immediacy) and Readiness Assessment (Cognitive/Emotional/Support).
- **The Intervention Gradient:** Codified the "Least Restrictive Alternative" hierarchy: Framing $\to$ Sequencing $\to$ Scaffolding $\to$ Strategic Withholding $\to$ Compassionate Inaccuracy.
- **The Scaffolding Ladder:** Introduced Appendix B as the standardized methodology for repaying Disclosure Debt (Emotional Regulation $\to$ Epistemic Humility).
- **Operational Templates:** Released the printable *Operational Assessment Worksheet* (PDF) and the *Audit Log* (CSV) for institutional tracking.
- **Glossary:** Defined critical terms including *Data-Weapon*, *Soul-Shatterer*, *Liar's Dividend*, and *Sunset Condition*.
- **Non-Derogable Constraints:** Established the three absolute red lines: No Permanent Concealment, No Self-Dealing, and Duty of Repair.

### Changed
- **Terminology Refinement:** Renamed "Information Hazard" to "Ontological Harm" to emphasize the recipient-centric impact over abstract risk.
- **Decision Logic:** Clarified that the "Sunset Condition" triggers a mandatory review/escalation of support, rather than automatic reckless disclosure.
- **Distinctions:** Sharpened the distinction between *Data-Weapons* (extrinsic/physical harm) and *Soul-Shatterers* (intrinsic/psychological harm).
